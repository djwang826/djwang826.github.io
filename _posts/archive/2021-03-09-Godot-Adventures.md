# And so the Godot Adventures begin.

*March 9th, 2021*

**Download, installation, and setup**

Today at work I watched the first couple videos of the [tutorial for Godot](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL9FzW-m48fn2SlrW0KoLT4n5egNdX-W9a). It introduced how the 2D world worked, how to set it up, and place objects and a player in the scene. It was a relatively easy process, taking less than half an hour to do altogether. I also coded in some basic movement for the player, so it can move in any direction. No animation of the player yet I'm afraid, as I will do that another day. Below is a screenshot of the scene and objects I have set up. Once I figure out how to do GIFs and record my screen I'll be putting that up - but for now a still image will have to do.
