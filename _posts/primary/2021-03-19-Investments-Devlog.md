Devlog of custom investment tracking website

*March 19th, 2021*

**Devlog #1: Planning**

Overall basic plan:
1. Research web portals, APIs, and mobile apps to collect USA stock data
2. Research how to setup stock transaction accounts
3. Determine what to invest in/divide up funds.

Plan for website:
1. Tech stack: React app, NodeJS?
2. Purpose is to have quick access to check on stats of the stocks/funds I bought.
3. V1 will be pretty static, if I want to add any new funds onto dashboard will have to do manually.
4. Future plans? Add database, ability to add the stocks from user end, filter stats.
